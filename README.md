# Overview

Simple text-based styled RP chat inspired by servers like LS-RP & GTA World. This chat comes with the basic commands needed for a roleplay server, nothing extra.

# Features

- This text chat was written entirely on the server side for optimization purposes. Keep in mind this is the default `chat` resource, it just has a lot of additional code.

- Includes the following commands:

`/me,
/my,
/do,
/pm,
/b (local ooc),
/low,
/shout,
/carlow,
/carshout`

- Discord logging using webhooks to log all `/me's` & `/do's`

# Installation

- Swap out your old `chat` resource in replace for this one. If you do not have one, be sure to put `ensure chat` in your server.cfg

# Requirements

- onesync infinity --> Your server must be running on `onesynce infinity` or this chat will **NOT** work. https://gyazo.com/833dd4a67a3c84fbe8e27eb697d6179e

- [es_extended](https://github.com/overextended/es_extended) --> This was made and tested on [Overextended's](https://github.com/overextended) version of ESX.

**NOTE: I will not be providing diirect support for this, the code is pretty simple and easy to work with if you know what your doing.**

Huge shoutout to `Dawg#8192` for helping with this project.
