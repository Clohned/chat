# Overview

Simple text-based styled RP chat inspired by servers like LS-RP & GTA World. This chat comes with the basic commands needed for a roleplay server, nothing extra.

# Features

- The `textchat` resource was written entirely on the server side for optimization purposes. The `chat` resource is just the default FiveM chat with a edited `.css`

- Includes the following commands:

`/me,
/my,
/do,
/pm,
/b (local ooc),
/low,
/shout,
/carlow,
/carshout`

- Discord logging using webhooks to log all `/me's` & `/do's`

# Installation

- Swap out your old `chat` resource in replace for this one.

- Put `ensure textchat` server.cfg.

# Requirements

- [es_extended](https://github.com/overextended/es_extended) --> This was made and tested on [Overextended's](https://github.com/overextended) version of ESX.

**NOTE: I will not be providing diirect support for this, the code is pretty simple and easy to work with if you know what your doing.**

Huge shoutout to `Dawg#8192` for helping with this project.
